# ArbiProof Business Model & Market Application

## Market Need

Optimistic rollups are increasingly becoming the preferred Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, but developers face challenges in:

1. **Understanding Fraud Proofs**: The technical complexity of fraud proof systems remains a barrier to wider adoption
2. **Testing Protocol Changes**: Changes to fraud proof systems are high-risk and difficult to test
3. **Gas Costs**: Implementing fraud verification on-chain remains prohibitively expensive
4. **Developer Experience**: Building & debugging fraud proofs has a steep learning curve

## Use Cases Made Possible by Stylus

ArbiProof enables several use cases that were previously impossible or economically unviable:

1. **Real-time Fraud Verification**: By reducing gas costs by over 70%, fraud proofs can now be verified on-chain in real-time, enabling faster transaction finality for Layer 2 solutions.

2. **On-chain ZK-Proof Integration**: Our benchmarks show that ZK-proof verification operations that would cost over $3 in Solidity can be executed for under $0.60 with Stylus, enabling hybrid systems that combine optimistic rollups with selective ZK verification.

3. **Financial Algorithm Execution**: Complex operations like options pricing that would be prohibitively expensive in Solidity can now be performed on-chain, enabling DeFi protocols with sophisticated risk models.

4. **Real-world Asset Tokenization**: The gas efficiency enables more complex validation logic for real-world assets, making RWA tokenization more secure and scalable.

5. **Advanced Gaming Logic**: Game state transitions that would exceed block gas limits in Solidity can now be executed efficiently on-chain, enabling more complex fully on-chain games.
